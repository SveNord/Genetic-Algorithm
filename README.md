# Genetic-Algorithm
A simple implementation of a genetic algorithm written in Java, to demonstrate the capabilities of the algorithm. This program uses a GA to find a given string.
There are a number of settings that you can change to see the impact on the algorithm. All of these settings can be found in the "Main.java" file.
Once you run the main program it will show you the best result of the current generation.
